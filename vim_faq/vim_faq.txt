SECTION 1 - GENERAL INFORMATION

 								*faq-1.1*
1.1. What is Vim?

Vim stands for Vi IMproved. It used to be Vi IMitation, but there are so
many improvements that a name change was appropriate. Vim is a text editor
which includes almost all the commands from the Unix program "Vi" and a lot
of new ones. All commands can be given with the keyboard. This has the
advantage that you can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on
the screen. For those who want it, there is mouse support and a GUI version
with scrollbars and menus.

Vim is an editor, not a word processor. A word processor is used mainly to
do layout of text. This means positioning it, changing the way it appears
on output. More often than not, the final document is meant to be printed
or typeset or what have you, in order to present it in a pleasing manner to
others. Examples of word processors are Microsoft Word, WordPerfect,
FrameMaker, and AmiPro.

An editor is simply for entering text. Any typesetting or laying out of the
document is secondary. With an editor, one's main concern is entering text,
not making the text look good. Examples of editors other than Vim and Vi
are Emacs, Crisp, Brief, and xedit.  And Notepad.

1.2. Who wrote Vim?

Most of Vim was written by Bram Moolenar, with contributions from too many
people to mention here. See ":h credits" for a complete list.

Vim is based on Stevie, worked on by Tim Thompson, Tony Andrews and G.R.
(Fred) Walter.

1.3. Is Vim compatible with Vi?

Yes. Vim is very much compatible with Vi.  You can use the "-C"
command-line flag to start Vim in Vi compatible mode: >

    $ vim -C
<
You can also use: >

1.4. What are some of the improvements of Vim over Vi?

A short summary of the improvements of Vim over vi is listed below.  The
list shows that Vim is a thoroughly modern and feature-packed editor.
Standard features of modern editors are implemented, and there is an equal
emphasis on general power-user features and features for programmers.

Features to modernise Vi:

  Multi-level undo
     Allows you to set the number of times you can undo your changes in a
     file buffer. You can also redo an undone change.
  Multiple windows and buffers
     Each file can be displayed in its own window. You can move easily from
     one window to another. Each file opened during a Vim session also has
     an associated buffer and you can easily jump from one to the other.
  Flexible insert mode
     Vim allows you to use the arrow keys while in insert mode to move
     around in the file. No more hitting <Esc>, moving around, then hitting
     `i' or `a'.
  Macros
     Vim has a facility which allows you to record a sequence of typed
     characters and repeat them any number of times.
  Visual mode
     You can highlight sections of text and execute operations on this
     section of text only.
  Block operators
     Allow selection and highlighting of rectangular blocks of text in
     order do execute specific operations on them.
  Online help system
     You can easily find help on any aspect of using Vim. Help is displayed
     in its own window.
  Command-line editing and history
     History allows you to use the arrow keys to repeat or search for a
     command that has already been typed. Allows you to match the beginning
     of a command with the beginning of another similar command in the
     history buffer. You can also edit a command to correct typos or change
     a few values.
  Command line completion.
     Using the <Tab> key, you can complete commands, options, filenames,
     etc. as needed.
  Horizontal scrolling.
     Long lines can be scrolled horizontally (with or without the GUI).

Advanced user features:

  Text formatting.
     With two keystrokes, you can format large sections of text, without
     the use of external programs.
  Word completion in Insert mode
     Vim can complete words while you are typing, by matching the current
     word with other similar words in the file.
  Jump tags
     Just like in an internet browser, you can jump back to previous parts
     of the text you were editing, and then forward again.  Your brain is
     thus free to edit instead of navigate.
  Automatic commands
     Commands automatically executed when reading or writing a file,
     jumping to another buffer, etc.
  Viminfo
     Allows storing of the command line history, marks and registers in a
     file to be read on startup.  Therefore, you can recall old search
     patterns, macros, etc., in a new Vim session.
  Mouse support
     The mouse is supported in an xterm and for MS-DOS. It can be used to
     position the cursor, select the visual area, paste a register, etc.
  Graphical User Interface (GUI)
     Just like any modern editor.  Also, it's very easy to add your own
     menus.  Of course, console vim is still supported, and very widely
     used.
  Scripting language
     Vim has a powerful scripting language so new commands can be created.
     You can also use Perl, Python, TCL and Ruby to achieve the same thing!
  Plugins
     Extra functionality implemented via vim commands (regular commands or
     the scripting language) that is automatically loaded on startup.
     Examples: file explorer, network editing.  More are being developed
     and shared on VimOnline all the time.
  Syntax highlighting for many programming languages
     Syntax highlighting for hundreds of programming languages is
     supported. Support for others can be added.
  Extended regular expressions
     Vim supports extended regular expressions which are similar in
     functionality to that of perl regular expressions.

Programming performance features:

  Edit-compile-edit speedup
     You can compile within Vim and automatically jump to the location of
     errors in the source code.
  Indenting for many programming languages
     C, C++, Java, Perl, XML and many other languages can be automatically
     indented by vim while you type.  Support for others can be added.
  Searching for words in include files
     Vim allows you to search for a match of the word under the cursor in
     the current and included files.
  Advance text objects
     Instantly select, or delete, or copy, or indent, or format, or change
     case, or ... to all the text between ( and ), or { and }, or < and >,
     or [ and ].  Or a word, sentence, or paragraph.  Very powerful.
  Folding
     Certain parts of the text can be "folded" away.  The best example is
     the body of a function.  You can get an overview of the code, and then
     open the fold of the function whose detail you need to see.
  ctags and cscope integration
     Using these two powerful programs, you can jump to a definition of a
     function from a calling instance of it, and use other tricks to
     navigate source code.

SECTION 2 - RESOURCES

 								*faq-2.1*
2.1. Where can I learn more about Vim?

You can post your Vim questions to the vim@vim.org mailing list.  You can
post your Vim development related questions to the vim-dev@vim.org mailing
list. Vim does not have a newsgroup of its own. But the appropriate
newsgroup to post to is comp.editors.

"VimOnline" is a web page that serves as a de facto homepage for vim,
although the main purpose of it is to gather tips and scripts from
everywhere.  Get involved!  The URL is vim.sourceforge.net or vim.sf.net.

Finally, read the Vi FAQ: >

    http://www.faqs.org/faqs/editor-faq/vi/part1/index.html
<
For more information, read >

    :help mail-list
    :help internet
<
 								*faq-2.2*
2.2. Is there a mailing list available?

There are several: >

    NAME              DESCRIPTION
<
    vim-announce      Announcements of new releases
    vim               General discussion
    vim-dev           Patches, bug reports, development discussions
    vim-mac           Macintosh discussion
    vim-fr            General discussion in French
    vim-multibyte     Multibyte development issues
    vim-vms           Development on VMS

Of these, only vim and vim-dev are of general interest.  vim-announce is
read-only to most people, and its messages are sent to the other lists as
well.  The remaining four are very low volume.

To subscribe:   send an email to <NAME>-subscribe@vim.org
To unsubscribe: send an email to <NAME>-unsubscribe@vim.org
To get help:    send an email to <NAME>-help@vim.org

 								*faq-2.3*
2.3. Is there an archive available for the Vim mailing lists?

Yes.  Visit http://www.yahoogroups.com/list/<name>, where name is one of:
vimannounce, vim, vimdev, vim-fr, vim-mac, vim-multibyte, vim-vms.

Alternatively, visit www.gmane.org to find out about GMANE, which allows
you to access the mailing lists as though they were newsgroups.  This
offers some convenience to those who wish to browse the history or casually
observe the current threads.

 								*faq-2.4*
2.4. Where can I get the Vim user manual in HTML/PDF/PS format?

You can download the HTML/PDF/PS format of the Vim user manual from: >

    http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/
<
 								*faq-2.5*
2.5. I have a "xyz" (some) problem with Vim. How do I determine it is a
     problem with my setup or with Vim?

First, you have to determine that the problem is not with your .vimrc or
.gvimrc or system vimrc or your personal plugin files or in any of your
setup files. To do this, use >

    $ vim -N -u NONE -U NONE
<
This will start Vim in 'nocompatible" mode and will not source your
personal .vimrc and .gvimrc files. It will also not load your personal
plugins. In this invocation of Vim, try to reproduce your problem. If you
are not able to reproduce the problem, then the problem is related to some
setting in one of your local setup files or plugins. To locate the problem
in your setup files, you have to use trial and error and try commenting out
the lines in your setup files one by one. You can also use the -V command
line argument to Vim to get more debug information and analyze the problem: >

    $ vim -V2
<
You can increase the value passed to the -V argument to get more debug
information.

For more information, read >

    :help -u
    :help -U
    :help -N
    :help -V
    :help 'verbose'
    :help :verbose
    :help set-verbose
<
 								*faq-2.6*
2.6. Where can I report bugs?

First collect the required information using the following command: >

    :source $VIMRUNTIME/bugreport.vim
<
Now send the resulting text from the above command to the bugs@vim.org
e-mail address.

The Vim Development mailing list (see above) is a good place to discuss
general bugs.  If the bug you find is with syntax highlighting or some
other "added feature" (i.e. not directly programmed into vim), attempt to
inform the maintainer of that feature.

For more information, read >

    :help bug-reports
<
 								*faq-2.7*
2.7. Where can the FAQ be found?

The FAQ can be found at VimOnline (vim.sf.net).  Other places will be
decided in the future.

 								*faq-2.8*
2.8. What if I don't find an answer in this FAQ?

This FAQ covers mainly Vim-specific questions. You may find more
information suitable for most Vi clones by reading the Vi FAQ. It is posted
regularly on comp.editors. You can also find a copy at >

    http://www.faqs.org/faqs/editor-faq/vi/part1/index.html
<
Also, since Vim has gathered so many features in the last few years,
successfully documenting the frequently asked questions here is a
near-impossible task.  To make it possible, please email the maintainer if
you have a good question.  A good question is one that you've tried to
answer yourself (remember, Vim has great documentation) but struggled.

 								*faq-2.9*
2.9. I have a patch for implementing a Vim feature. Where can I send this
     patch?

You can send your patches to the Vim developer mailing list
vim-dev@vim.org.

For more information, read >

    :help vim-dev
<
 								*faq-2.10*
2.10. I have a Vim tip or developed a new Vim
      syntax/indent/filetype/compiler plugin or developed a new script or a
      colorscheme. Is there a public website where I can upload this?

Yes. You can use the Vim Online website to upload your plugins/scripts,
colorschemes, tips, etc. The site is at http://vim.sourceforge.net

=============================================================================
 								*faq-4*
SECTION 4 - HELP

 								*faq-4.1*
4.1. How do I use the help files?

Help can be found for all functions of Vim. In order to use it, use the
":help" command.  This will bring you to the main help page. On that first
page, you will find explanations on how to move around. Basically, you move
around in the help pages the same way you would in a read-only document.
You can jump to specific subjects by using tags. This can be done in two
ways:

   * Use the "<Ctrl-]>" command while standing on the name of a command or
     option. This only works when the tag is a keyword. "<Ctrl-LeftMouse>"
     and "g<LeftMouse>" work just like "<Ctrl-]>".
   * use the ":tag <subject>" command. This works with all characters.

Use "<Ctrl-T>" to jump back to previous positions in the help files. Use
":q" to close the help window.

If you want to jump to a specific subject on the help pages, use ":help
{subject}". If you don't know what to look for, try ":help index" to get a
list of all available subjects. Use the standard search keys to locate the
information you want. You can abbreviate the ":help" command as ":h".

For more information, read >

    :help online-help
<
 								*faq-4.2*
4.2. How do I search for a keyword in the Vim help files?

You can press the CTRL-D key after typing the help keyword to get a list of
all the help keywords containing the supplied pattern. You can also use the
meta characters like *, \+, etc to specify the help search pattern: >

    :help init<C-D>
    :help str*()<C-D>
    :help '*indent<C-D>
<
You can press the Tab key after typing a partial help keyword to expand to
the matching keyword. You can continue to press the Tab key to see other
keyword matches.

From the help window, you can use the ":tag" command to search for
keywords. For example, >

    :tselect /window
<
This command will list all the help keywords containing the text "window".
You can select one from the list and jump to it.

You can use the ":helpgrep" command to search for the given text in all the
help files. The quickfix window will be opened with all the matching lines.

For more information, read >

    :help c_CTRL-D
    :help c_<Tab>
    :help :tselect
    :help :help
    :help :helpgrep
<
 								*faq-4.3*
4.3. I am getting an error message E123, what did I do wrong?

You can get more information about the error and the error message using: >

    :help E123
<
For more information, read >

    :help error-messages
<
 								*faq-4.4*
4.4. Where can I read about the various modes in Vim?

You can get information about the different modes in Vim by reading >

    :help vim-modes
<
 								*faq-4.5*
4.5. How do I generate the Vim help tags file after adding a new Vim help
     file?

You can use the ":helptags" command to regenerate the Vim help tag file.
For example: >

    :cd $VIMRUNTIME/doc
    :helptags .
<
For more information, read >

    :help :helptags
    :help add-local-help
<
 								*faq-4.6*
4.6. Can I use compressed versions of the help files?

Yes. You can compress the help files and still be able to view them with
Vim.  This makes accessing the help files a bit slower and requires the
"gzip" utility. Follow these steps to compress and use the Vim help files:

- Compress all the help files using "gzip ddoc/*.txt".

- Edit the "doc/tags" file and change the "".txt" to ".txt.gz" using
        :%s=\(\t.*\.txt\)\t=\1.gz\t=

- Add the following line to your vimrc:
        set helpfile={dirname}/help.txt.gz

Where {dirname} is the directory where the help files are.  The gzip.vim
plugin supplied with the standard Vim distribution will take care of
decompressing the files.  You must make sure that $VIMRUNTIME is set to
where the other Vim files are, when they are not in the same location as
the compressed "doc" directory.

 								*faq-6.4*
6.4. How do I configure Vim to autoload several files at once similar to
     "work-sets" or "projects"?

You can use the ":mksession" and the ":mkview" commands to autoload several
files in Vim.

The ":mksession" command creates a Vim script that restores the current
editing session. You can use the ":source" command to source the file
produced by the mksession command.

The ":mkview" command creates a Vim script that restores the contents of
the current window. You can use the ":loadview" command to load the view
for the current file.

SECTION 7 - BACKUP

 								*faq-7.1*
7.1. When I edit and save files, Vim creates a file with the same name as
     the original file and a "~" character at the end. How do I stop Vim
     from creating this file? (or) How do I disable the Vim backup file
     feature?

You have set the 'backup' option, so Vim creates a backup file when saving
the original file. You can stop Vim from creating the backup file, by
clearing the option: >

    :set nobackup
<
Note that, by default this option is turned off. You have explicitly
enabled the 'backup' option in one of the initialization files. You may
also have to turn off the 'writebackup' option: >

7.2. How do I configure Vim to store all the backup files in a particular
     directory?

You can configure Vim to store all the backup files in a particular
directory using the 'backupdir' option. For example, to store all the
backup files in the ~/backup directory, you can use the following command: >

    :set backupdir=~/backup

 								*faq-7.3*
7.3. When I save a file with Vim, the file permissions are changed.
     How do I configure Vim to save a file without changing the file
     permissions?

This may happen, if the 'backupcopy' option is set to 'no' or 'auto'. Note
that the default value for this option is set in such a way that this will
correctly work in most of the cases. If the default doesn't work for you,
try setting the 'backupcopy' option to 'yes' to keep the file permission
when saving a file: >

    :set backupcopy=yes
<
This applies, only if you have configured Vim to make a backup whenever
overwriting a file. By default, Vim will not backup files.

SECTION 8 - BUFFERS

 								*faq-8.1*
8.1. I have made some modifications to a buffer. How do I edit another
     buffer without saving the modified buffer and also without losing the
     modifications?

You can set the 'hidden' option to edit a file without losing modifications
to the current file: >

    :set hidden
<
By setting the 'hidden' option, you can also save the modification history
(undo-history) for the buffer. Otherwise, as you switch between files, the

     buffers are deleted. Why?

In the ":%bd" command, the '%' range will be replaced with the starting and
ending line numbers in the current buffer. Instead of using '%' as the

SECTION 9 - WINDOWS

 								*faq-9.1*
9.1. What is the difference between a Vim window and a buffer?

A Vim buffer is a file loaded into memory for editing. The original file
remains unchanged until you write the buffer to the file. A Vim window is a
viewport onto a buffer. You can use multiple windows on one buffer or
several windows on different buffers.

9.2. How do I increase the width of a Vim window?

You can increase the width of a Vim window using one of the following
commands: >

    :vert resize +N
    :vert resize -N
    :vert resize N
<
You can also use CTRL-W < or CTRL-W > or CTRL-W | commands.

    :help CTRL-W_>
    :help CTRL-W_<
    :help window-resize
<
 								*faq-9.3*
9.3. How do I zoom into or out of a window?

You can zoom into a window (close all the windows except the current
window) using the "CTRL-W o" command or the ":only" ex command.

You can use the "CTRL-W _" command or the ":resize" ex command to increase
the current window height to the highest possible without closing other
windows.

You can use the "CTRL-W |" command or the ":vertical resize" ex command to
increase the current window width to the highest possible without closing
other windows.

You can use the "CTRL-W =" command to make the height and width of all the
windows equal.

You can also set the following options to get better results with the above
commands:

Method 1:
Set the 'winminheight' option to 0: >

    :set winminheight=0
<
By default, this option is set to 1.
This option controls the minimum height of an inactive window (when it is
not the current window).  When the 'winminheight' option is set to 0, only
the status line will be displayed for inactive windows.

Method 2:
Set the 'noequalalways' option and set the 'winheight' option to a large
value (like 99999): >

    :set noequalalways
    :set winheight=99999
<
Now, the active window will always open to its maximum size, while the
other windows will stay present, but shrunken to just a status line.

With any of the above mentioned methods, you cannot restore the window
layout after zooming into a window.  If you want to restore the Vim window
layout after zooming into a window, you can use the ZoomWin plugin. You can
download this plugin from the Vim online website at:

http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=508

10.2. In insert mode, when I press the <Esc> key to go to command mode, the
     cursor moves one character to the left (except when the cursor is on
     the first character of the line). Is it possible to change this
     behavior to keep the cursor at the same column?

No. It is not possible to change this behavior. The cursor is *always*
positioned on a valid character (unless you have virtual-edit mode
enabled). So, if you are appending text to the end of a line, when you
return to command mode the cursor *must* drop back onto the last character
you typed. For consistency sake, the cursor drops back everywhere, even if
you are in the middle of a line.

You can use the CTRL-O command in insert mode to execute a single ex
command and return back to insert mode without moving the cursor column.

     line on the screen. How do I move from one screen line to the next?

You can use the gj and gk commands to move from one screen line to the
next/previous screen line. The j and k commands move the cursor from one
file line to the next file line. You can also avoid the line wrapping by
resetting the 'wrap' option: >

10.5. What is the definition of a sentence, paragraph and section in Vim?

A sentence is defined as ending at a '.', '!' or '?' followed by either the
end of a line, or by a space (or two) or tab. Which characters and the
number of spaces needed to constitute a sentence ending is determined by
the 'joinspaces' and 'cpoptions' options.

A paragraph begins after each empty line, and also at each of a set of
paragraph macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the 'paragraphs'
option.

A section begins after a form-feed (<C-L>) in the first column and at each
of a set of section macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the
'sections' option.

      motion  position    where
      (       beginning   current sentence
      )       end         current sentence

10.9. When I use my arrow keys, Vim changes modes, inserts weird characters
     in my document but doesn't move the cursor properly. What's going on?

There are a couple of things that could be going on: either you are using
Vim over a slow connection or Vim doesn't understand the key sequence that
your keyboard is generating.

If you are working over a slow connection (such as a 2400 bps modem), you
can try to set the 'timeout' or 'ttimeout' option. These options, combined
with the 'timeoutlen' and 'ttimeoutlen' options, may fix the problem.

The preceding procedure will not work correctly if your terminal sends key
codes that Vim does not understand. In this situation, your best option is
to map your key sequence to a matching cursor movement command and save
these mappings in a file. You can then ":source" the file whenever you work
from that terminal.

the cursor to the end of the previous line, when the left arrow key is
pressed and the cursor is currently at the beginning of a line: >

    :set whichwrap+=<

You can exchange two lines with the "ddp" command sequence. The 'dd' will
delete the current line and 'p' will paste the just deleted line after the
current line. This will result in exchanging the two lines. 

All of the above operations will change the " unnamed register.

You can use the ":m +" ex command to exchange two lines without changing the
unnamed register.

SECTION 13 - COMPLETION IN INSERT MODE

 								*faq-13.1*
13.1. How do I complete words or lines in insert mode?

In insert mode, you can complete words using the CTRL-P and CTRL-N keys.
The CTRL-N command searches forward for the next matching keyword.
The CTRL-P command searches backwards for the next matching keyword.

In insert mode, you can use the CTRL-X CTRL-L command sequence to complete
lines that starts with the same characters as in the current line before
the cursor. To get the next matching line, press the CTRL-P or CTRL-N keys.
There are a lot of other keys/ways available to complete words in insert

14.13. I am seeing a lot of ^M symbols in my file. I tried setting the
       'fileformat' option to 'dos' and then 'unix' and then 'mac'. None of
       these helped. How can I hide these symbols?

When a file is loaded in Vim, the format of the file is determined as
below:

- If all the lines end with a new line (<NLL>), then the fileformat is
  'unix'.
- If all the lines end with a carriage retuurn (<CR>) followed by a new line
  (<NL>), then the fileformat is 'dos'.
- If all the lines end with carriage returnn (<CR>), then the fileformat is
  'mac'.

If the file has some lines ending with <CR> and some lines ending with <CR>
followed by a <NL>, then the fileformat is set to 'unix'.

You can change the format of the current file, by modifying the
'fileformat' option and then saving the file: >

    :set fileformat=dos
    :w
<
To display the format of the current file, use >

    :set fileformat?
<
The above behavior is also controlled by the 'fileformats' option. You can

14.14. When I paste some text into a Vim buffer from another application,
      the alignment (indentation) of the new text is messed up. How do I
      fix this?

The indentation of the text is messed up due to various Vim settings
related to indentation (like autoindent, smartindent, textwidth etc).
Before pasting text into Vim, you can set the 'paste' option: >

    :set paste
<
After pasting the text, you can turn off the option using: >

    :set nopaste

SECTION 15 - VISUAL MODE

 								*faq-15.1*
15.1. How do I do rectangular block copying?

You can do rectangular block copying in Vim using the blockwise visual
mode. To start blockwise visual mode use the CTRL-V key. Move the cursor
using any of the motion commands and then use the y operator to yank to
visually selected text.

If CTRL-V does not work as expected, it may have been remapped to CTRL-Q by
the mswin.vim script which is often sourced by a vimrc on Windows machines
to mimic some common short cuts from other programs.

 								*faq-15.3*
15.3. How do I apply an ex-command on a set of visually selected lines?

When you select a range of lines in visual mode, the < register is set to
the start of the visual region and the > register is set to the end of the
visual region. You can use these registers to specify the range for an ex
command. After visually selecting the lines, press ":" to go to the command
mode.  Vim will automatically insert the visual range '<,'>. You can run
any ex-command on the visual range.

This will happen if you have configured Vim to use select mode instead of
Visual mode by setting the 'selectmode' option. Check the value of this
option: >

    :set selectmode?
<
This mode is known as selectmode and is similar to the visual mode. This
option is also automatically set when you use the "behave mswin" command.

selecting text using mouse, remove the 'mouse' value from the 'selectmode'
option: >

You can use the command-line window for editing Vim command-line text. To
open the Vim command-line window use the "q:" command in normal mode. In
command-line mode, use the CTRL-F key. In this window, the command line
history will be displayed. You can use normal Vim keys/commands to edit any
previous/new command line. To execute a command line, press the

 								*faq-16.4*
16.4. How do I copy the output from an ex-command into a buffer?

To copy the output from an ex-command into a buffer, you have to first get
the command output into a register. You can use the ":redir" command to get
the output into a register. For example, >

    :redir @a
    :g/HelloWord/p
    :redir END
<
Now the register 'a' will contain the output from the ex command
"g/HelloWord/p". Now you can paste the contents of the register 'a' into a
buffer. You can also send or append the output of an ex-command into a file
using the 'redir' command.

You can prefix the ":global" command with ":silent", to avoid having the
lines printed to the screen.

To redirect the output from an ex-command to a file, you can use the
following set of commands: >

    :redir > myfile
    :g/HelloWord/p
    :redir END
<

      matching filenames. How do I configure Vim to only display the list
      of all the matching filenames and not complete the first one?

You can modify the 'wildmode' option to configure the way Vim completes
filenames in the command mode. In this case, you can set the 'wildmode'
option to 'list': >

    :set wildmode=list

    :help 'wildmode'
<
 								*faq-16.6*
16.6. How do I copy text from a buffer to the command line and from the
      command line to a buffer?

To copy text from a buffer to the command line, after yanking the text from
the buffer, use Ctrl-R 0 in the command line to paste the text. You can
also yank the text to a specific register and use CTRL-R <register> to
paste the text to the command line.  You can use CTRL-R CTRL-W to paste the
word under the cursor in the command line.

To copy text from the command line into a buffer, you can paste the
contents of the : register using the ":p command. The most recently
executed command line is stored in the : register.

Another approach for copying and pasting text to and from the command line
is to open the command line window using q: from normal mode or CTRL-F from
the command-line mode. In the command line window you can use all the Vim
commands to edit the command line.

 								*faq-19.5*
19.5. Can I add (embed) Vim option settings to the contents of a file?

You can use modelines to add Vim option settings to the contents of a file.
For example, in a C file, you can add the following line to the top or the
bottom of the file: >

    /* vim:sw=4: */
<
This will set the 'shiftwidth' option to 4, when editing that C file.
For this to work, the 'modeline' option should be set. By default, the
'modeline' option is set. The 'modelines' settings specifies the number of
lines that will be checked for the Vim set commands.

The width used for displaying the line numbers for the 'number' option is
hard-coded in Vim. It is not possible to change this width by setting some
option.

The request and the patch to add an option to change the number of columns
used for the 'number' option is in the Vim todo list: >

    "Add an option to set the width of the 'number' column.  Eight
    positions is often more than needed.  Or adjust the width to the length

19.8. How do I display (view) all the invisible characters like space, tabs
      and newlines in a file?

You can set the 'list' option to see all the invisible characters in your
file. >

    :set list
<
With this option set, you can view space characters, tabs, newlines,
trailing space characters and wrapped lines.

To not display the invisible characters (which is the default), you have to
reset the 'list' option: >

    :set nolist
    (or)
    :set list!
<
The ":set list!" command will toggle the current setting of the boolean
'list' option.

You can modify the 'listchars' option to configure how and which invisible
characters are displayed. For example, with the following command all the
trailing space characters will be displayed with a '.' character. >

 								*faq-19.15*
19.15. Why do I hear a beep (why does my window flash) about 1 second after
       I hit the Escape key?

This is normal behavior. If your window flashes, then you've got the visual
bell on. Otherwise, you should hear a beep.

Vim needs a timeout to tell the difference between a simple escape and,
say, a cursor key sequence.  When you press a key in normal mode (and even
in insert mode) and that key is the beginning of a mapping, Vim waits a
certain amount of time to see if the rest of the mapping sequence follows.
If the mapping sequence is completed before a given timeout period, the
mapping for that sequence of keys is applied. If you interrupt the mapping,
the normal actions associated with the keys are executed.

For example, if you have a mapping defined as ":imap vvv Vim is great!!"
and you type "vvv" quickly, the "Vim is great!!" will be inserted into your
text. But if you type "vv v" then that is what will put into your text.
This is also true if you type "vvv" too slowly where "too slowly" is longer
than the value for the timeout option. Setting the timeout option to a
larger value can help alleviate problems that appear when using function
keys over a slow line.

 								*faq-19.17*
19.17. How do I remove more than one flag using a single ":set" command
       from a Vim option?

You can remove more than one flag from a Vim option using a single ":set"
command, by specifying the flags in exactly the same order as they appear
in the option. For example, if you use the following command to remove the
't' and 'n' flags from the 'formatoptions' option: >

    :set formatoptions-=tn
<
The 't' and 'n' flags will be removed from the 'formatoptions' option, only
if the 'formatoptions' option contains these flags in this order: 'tn'.
Otherwise, it will not remove the flags. To avoid this problem, you can
remove the flags one by one: >

    :set formatoptions-=t formatoptions-=n

20.7. In a Vim script, how do I know which keys to use for my mappings, so
      that the mapped key will not collide with an already used key?

Vim uses most of the keys in the keyboard. You can use the <leader> prefix
in maps to define keys which will not overlap with Vim keys. For example: >

    :map <leader>S <C-W>s
    :map <leader>j <C-W>j
    :map <leader>k <C-W>k
<
where by default <leader> gets substituted with a backslash (\), so the
user would enter >

        \j
        \k
<
to invoke the above map commands. The user can change the mapleader
variable to be whatever they wanted: >

    :let mapleader = ","
<
When writing a plugin or other script, more often than not, it is advisable

Make sure you have not defined a mapping for this key using the following
command: >

    :map <key>
<
If a mapping is defined for this key and the mapped key contains more than
one character, then Vim will wait for the next character to be pressed to
determine whether it is the mapped key or not. For example, if you have
mapped "ab", then if you press "a", Vim will wait for the next key to be
pressed. If the next key is "b", Vim will execute the mapped sequence.
Otherwise, Vim will proceed with the normal processing of "a" followed by
the next key. If the 'timeout' option is set (which is the default), then
Vim will timeout after waiting for the period specified with the
'timeoutlen' option (default is 1 second).

 								*faq-20.15*
20.15. How do I map a key to run an external command using a visually
       selected text?

You can the ":vmap" command to map a key in the visual mode. In the mapped
command sequence, you have to first yank the text. The yanked text is
available in the '"' register. Now, you can use the contents of this
register to run the external command. For example, to run the external
command "perldoc" on a visually selected text, you can use the following
mapping: >

    :vmap <F7> y:!exec "!perldoc '" . @" . "'"<CR>
<
If you want the mapping to work in the visual mode, but not with the
highlighted text, you can use the following command: >

    :vmap <F7> :<C-U>!perldoc <cword><CR>
<
The above mapping will use the word under the cursor instead of the
highlighted text. Note the use of the <C-U> before invoking the "perldoc"
external command. The <C-U> is used to erase the range of text selected in
the visual mode and displayed on the command line. If the visual range is
not removed using <C-U>, then the output from the external command will
replace the visually selected text.

will be expanded without adding a space character at the end.

Another alternative is to use the following function and command:

24.2. How do I change the background and foreground colors used by Vim?

Vim uses the "Normal" highlight group for the background and foreground
colors. To change the foreground/background colors, you have to modify the
"Normal" highlight group. For example, to set the background color to blue
and foreground color to white, you can use >

    :highlight Normal ctermbg=blue ctermfg=white guibg=blue guifg=white

24.8. Vim syntax highlighting is broken. When I am editing a file, some
      parts of the file is not syntax highlighted or syntax highlighted
      incorrectly.

Vim doesn't read the whole file to parse the text for syntax highlighting.
It starts parsing wherever you are viewing the file. That saves a lot of
time, but sometimes the colors are wrong. A simple fix is refreshing the
screen using the CTRL-L key. Or scroll back a bit and then forward again.
You can also use the command: >

    :syntax sync fromstart

24.12. How do I replace a standard syntax file that comes with the Vim
       distribution with my own syntax file?

You can replace a standary syntax file that comes with the Vim distribution
by creating a file with the same name as the original syntax file and
placing it in the vim runtime syntax (~/.vim/syntax) directory. For
example, to replace the c.vim syntax file in a Unix system, place the new
c.vim in the ~/.vim/syntax directory. In a MS-Windows system, place the new
syntax file in the $HOME/vimfiles/syntax or $VIM/vimfiles/syntax directory.

SECTION 26 - PLUGINS

 								*faq-26.1*
26.1. How do I set different options for different types of files?

You can create filetype plugins to set different options for different
types of files. You should first enable filetype plugins using the command: >

    :filetype plugin on
<
A filetype plugin is a vim script that is loaded whenever Vim opens or
creates a file of that type.  For example, to ensure that the 'textwidth'
option is set to 80 when editing a C program (filetype 'c'), create one of
the following files: >

        ~/.vim/ftplugin/c.vim (Unix)
        %HOME%\vimfiles\ftplugin\c.vim (Windows)
<
with the following text in it: >

        setlocal textwidth=80
<
You can also use autocommands to set specific options when editing specific
type of files. For example, to set the 'textwidth' option to 75 for only
*.txt files, you can use the following autocmd: >

    autocmd BufRead *.txt setlocal textwidth=80

<
For Unix systems, this is usally the "$HOME/.vim" directory. For MS-Windows
systems, this is usually the $VIM\vimfiles or $HOME\vimfiles directory.
Depending on the type of the runtime file, you have to place it under a

26.3. How do I extend an existing filetype plugin?

You can extend an existing filetype plugin by creating a file under either
the $VIMRTUNTIME/after/ftplugin or the $VIMRTUNTIME/ftplugin directory. The
name of the file should be the same as the name of the existing filetype
plugin file. You can place your additions to the new file.

If you placed the file in the after/ftplugin runtime directory, then Vim
will first source the existing filetype plugin file and then will source
the new file.  If you placed the file in the $VIMRTUNTIME/ftplugin runtime
directory, then Vim will first source the new file and then will source the
existing filetype plugin file.

<
You can turn off loading the filetype plugins using: >

 								*faq-26.6*
26.6. How do I override settings made in a file type plugin in the global
      ftplugin directory for all the file types?

You can use an autocommand triggered on the FileType event: >

    au Filetype * set formatoptions=xyz
<
This should at least be after "filetype on" in your vimrc. Best is to put
it in your "myfiletypefile" file, so that it's always last.

If you want to override a setting for a particular filetype, then create a
file with the same name as the original filetype plugin in the
~/.vim/after/ftplugin directory For example, to override a setting in the
c.vim filetype plugin, create a c.vim file in the ~/.vim/after/ftplugin
directory and add your preferences in this file.

You can set the 'filetype' option for files with names matching a
particular pattern using an autocmd. For example, to set the 'filetype'
option to 'c' for all files with extension '.x', you can use the following
autocmd: >

    autocmd! BufRead,BufNewFile *.x     setfiletype c
<
A better alternative to the above approach is to create a filetype.vim file
in the ~/.vim directory (or in one of the directories specified in the
'runtimepath' option) and add the following lines: >

    " my filetype file
    if exists("did_load_filetypes")
        finish

    :e %:t:r.h
<
You can use the following command to edit the file in a new split window: >

    :sp %:t:r.h
<
In the above commands, the percent sign expands to the name of the current
file.  The ":t" modifier extracts the tail (last component) of the
filename. The ":r" modifier extracts the root of the filename.  The .h is
appended to the resulting name to get the header filename.

      the command?

You can use the :! command to pipe the contents of the current buffer to a
external command and replace the contents of the buffer with the output
from the command. For example, to sort the contents of the current buffer,
using the Unix sort command, you can use the following command: >

    :%!sort
<
To sort only lines 10-20, you can use the following command >

    :10,20!sort
<
Also, if you want to pipe a buffer to an external command but not put the
results back in the buffer, you can use >

    :w !sort
<
The above command will pipe the entire buffer to the sort command.  Note
that the space between the 'w' and the '!' is critical.  To pipe only a
range of lines, you can use >

The way Vim is designed, the cursor position has to be in a visible spot in
normal, visual, select and insert mode. This cannot be changed without
modifying Vim. When the scrollbar is used, the cursor will be moved so that
it is always visible. Another approach to solving this problem is to use
the Vim marks. You can mark the current cursor position using ma. Then
scroll to a different part of the text and jump back to the old position

31.15. How do I change the location and size of a GUI Vim window?

You can use the "winpos" command to change the Vim window position. To
change the size of the window, you can modify the "lines" and "columns"
options.

For example, the following commands will position the GUI Vim window at the
X,Y co-ordinates 50,50 and set the number of lines to 50 and the number of
columsn to 80. >

    :winpos 50 50
    :set lines=50
    :set columns=80
<
The arguments to the 'winpos' command specify the pixel co-ordinates of the
Vim window. The 'lines' and 'columns' options specify the number of lines
and characters to use for the height and the width of the window
respectively.

 								*faq-32.1*
32.1. I am running Vim in a xterm. When I press the CTRL-S key, Vim
      freezes. What should I do now?

Many terminal emulators and real terminal drivers use the CTRL-S key to
stop the data from arriving so that you can stop a fast scrolling display
to look at it (also allowed older terminals to slow down the computer so
that it did not get buffer overflows).  You can start the output again by
pressing the CTRL-Q key.

When you press the CTRL-S key, the terminal driver will stop sending the
output data. As a result of this, it will look like Vim is hung. If you
press the CTRL-Q key, then everything will be back to normal.

You can turn off the terminal driver flow control using the 'stty' command: >

    $ stty -ixon -ixoff
<
or, you can change the keys used for the terminal flow control, using the
following commands: >

    $ stty stop <char>
    $ stty start <char>
<
 								*faq-32.2*
32.2. I am seeing weird screen update problems in Vim. What can I do to

You have to make sure that Vim gets the correct keycode for the backpspace
key. You can try using the command: >

    :fixdel
<
Make sure the TERM environment variable is set to the correct terminal
name. You can try using the 'stty' command: >

    $ stty erase ^H

32.4. I am using Vim in a xterm. When I quit Vim, the screen contents are
      restored back to the original contents. How do I disable this?

The xterm has a capability called "alternate screen".  If this capability
is present, vim switches to that alternate screen upon startup and back on
exit, thus restoring the original screen contents.  To disable this
feature, add the following line to your .vimrc file: >

    :set t_ti= t_te=

<
 								*faq-32.5*
32.5. When I start Vim, it takes quite a few seconds to start. How do I
      minimize the startup time?

This may be related to Vim opening the X display for setting the xterm
title and using the X clipboard. Make sure the DISPLAY variable is set to
point to the correct host. Try using the command line: >

    $ vim -X
<
This will prevent Vim from opening the X display. With this command-line
option, the X clipboard cannot be used and also Vim will not be able to
change the xterm title.

You can also set the 'clipboard' option to >

    :set clipboard=exclude:.*

 								*faq-32.10*
32.10. How do I get the Vim syntax highlighting to work in a Unix terminal?

The easiest and simplest way to get Vim syntax highlighting is to use the
GUI version of Vim (GVIM). To get syntax highlighting to work in the
console/terminal version of Vim, you have to run a terminal emulator (like
Xfree86 xterm or rxvt or dtterm) that supports color. Note that if a
terminal emulator supports changing the background and foreground colors,
that does not mean that it also supports ANSI escape sequences for changing
the color. You can download the latest version of Xfree86 xterm from
http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.html. You can download the latest version
of rxvt from http://www.rxvt.org. You have to install the terminfo/termcap
file that supports colors for the terminal emulator. Also, set the TERM
environment variable to the correct name of the term that supports colors.

You can use the colortest.vim script supplied with the Vim runtime
package to test the color setup. To use this script, follow these steps: >

    :e $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/colortest.vim
    :source %
<

33.1. In MS-Windows, CTRL-V doesn't start the blockwise visual mode. What
      happened?

The mswin.vim script provides key mappings and options to make Vim behave
like a MS-Windows application. One of the keys mapped is CTRL-V which is
used for pasting text in MS-Windows applications. This will disable the use
of CTRL-V to start the blockwise visual mode. The mswin.vim script maps
CTRL-Q for staring the blockwise visual mode. So you can use CTRL-Q instead
of CTRL-V.

    Do you really want to write to it (y/n)?
<
then this problem could be related to a bug in MS-Windows on the day
daylight saving time starts.  Vim remembers the timestamp of the file after
it was written.  Just before the next write the timestamp is obtained again
to check if the file was changed outside of Vim.  This works correctly,
except on the day daylight saving time starts.

This problem will go away the next day after the day the daylight saving
time starts.

35.3. How do I build Vim from the sources on a MS-Windows system?

For a MS-Windows system, Vim can be built using either the Visual C++
compiler or the Borland C++ compiler or the Ming GCC compiler or the cygwin
gcc compiler. Follow these steps to build Vim from the sources for
MS-Windows:

- Download the source (vim##src.zip), runtiime (vim##rt.zip) and the extra
  (vim-##-extra.tar.gz) archives from the ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc
  directory.
- Extract the archives into a directory (foor example, c:\vimsrc)
- Depending on the installed compiler, you  can use the corresponding
  makefile to build the Vim sources. For Visual C++ use the Make_mvc.mak
  makefile, for borland C++ use the Make_bc5.mak makefile, for ming GCC use
  the Make_ming.mak makefile, for cygwin gcc use the Make_cyg.mak makefile.

Depending on whether you want to build the GUI version of Vim or the
console version of Vim, you have to pass different arguments to the
makefiles. After successfully building the sources, you can copy the
vim.exe or gvim.exe file to the desired directory along with the files from
the runtime archive.

You can visit the following site for extensive information about building
Vim on a MS-Windows system using the various compilers: >

36.7. How do I invoke Vim from command line to run a group of commands on a
      group of files?

There are several ways to invoke Vim from command line to run a group of
commands on a group of files. You can use a set of  "-c" command line
options to specify a group of commands: >

    $ vim -c "<ex_command_1>" -c "<ex_command_2>" *.txt
<
Each of the ex-command specified with the "-c" command line option is
executed one by one sequentially. You can also use a single "-c" command
line option and the "|" character to separate the ex commands: >

    $ vim -c "<ex_command_1> | <ex_command_2>" *.txt
<
In the above command, if an ex command fails, then all the remaining ex
commands will not be executed.

For example, to replace "ABC" with "DEF" in a file from the command-line,
you can use the following command: >

    $ vim -c "%s/ABC/DEF/ge | update" myfile.txt
<
To replace "ABC" with "DEF" in multiple files from the command-line,
you can use the following command: >

    $ vim -c "argdo %s/ABC/DEF/ge | update" *.txt
<
You can store the group of commands into a file and use the "-s" command
line option to run the commands on a set of files. For example, if the
group of commands are stored in the file mycmds.txt, then you can use the
following command: >

Utf-8 is called utf-8 or utf8; utf-16 is called ucs-2 or ucs2; utf-32 is
called ucs-4 or ucs4. Also, you may specify endianness (except for utf-8
which does not vary for endianness) by appending le for little-endian or be
for big-endian. If you create a file with an encoding of ucs-2 or ucs-4
without specifying endianness, Vim will use what is typical of your
machine.

37.5. How does Vim specify the presence or absence of a byte-order mark?

When reading a file, if the 'fileencodings' option includes "ucs-bom", Vim
will check for a byte-order mark. When writing a file, if the 'bomb' option
is set, Vim will write a byte-order mark on files whose encoding warrants
it.

 								*faq-37.6*
37.6. What is the 'fileencoding' option?

The 'fileencoding' option defines the particular encoding which Vim will
use to write a file. If empty, then the value of the 'encoding' option is
the default.

37.7. What is the 'fileencodings' option?

The 'fileencodings' option defines the heuristics used by Vim when opening
an existing file. It is a comma separated list of encodings. A special
name, "ucs-bom" is used to indicate that Vim should check for the presence
of a byte-order mark; however, it will not be recognised if it comes after
"utf-8".  Normally, "ucs-bom" (if present) should be first in the list.

When Vim opens a file, it checks it against the encodings listed in
'fileencodings'. The first one that matches is used. If there is no match,
then Vim sets 'fileencoding' to the null string, i.e., the value of
'encoding' will be used.

37.8. What is the 'termencoding' option?

The 'termencoding' option defines how your keyboard encodes the data you
type.  If empty, Vim assumes that it has the same value as 'encoding'.
Usually it should be set to something that matches your locale.

 								*faq-37.9*
37.9. What is the 'bomb' option?

When reading a file with "ucs-bom" present in the 'fileencodings' option,
Vim will set the 'bomb' option on or off depending on the presence or
absence of a byte-order mark at the start of the file. When writing, Vim
will write a byte-order mark if the 'bomb' option is set. You may set or
unset it manually do make Vim write, or not write, the b.o.m.

37.10. Where can I find an example of a typical use of all these options?

There is a "tip", with explains them in different words with an example, at
http://vim.sourceforge.net/tip_view.php?tip_id=246 .

 								*faq-37.11*
37.11. How can I insert Unicode characters into a file using Vim?

Several methods are available:

- Characters present on your keyboard can bbe typed in the usual way, even
  those which require a "dead-key" prefix, like (for instance) the
  circumflex on French keyboards.
- Characters for which a digraph is definedd can be typed as two characters
  prefixed by <Ctrl-K>.
- If you have set the 'digraph' option, youu can enter the characters for
  which a digrph is defined as <char1><BS><char2>.
- Any character can be entered by using a <<Ctrl-V> prefix (or <Ctrl-Q> if
  <Ctrl-V> is remapped to paste from the clipboard).

<
 								*faq-37.12*
37.12. How can I know which digraphs are defined and for which characters?

First set the 'encoding' option properly (for instance, to utf-8), then use
the :digraphs command to list the currently defined digraphs.
